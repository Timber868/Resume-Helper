I am submitting an application for the C++ Software Developer Intern position for the period
from May 4 to August 21, 2026. I am a Software Engineering Co-op student at McGill University
and have enjoyed building C++ systems that integrate with robots developed within my design
team. More recently, I’ve also been exploring GLSL in preparation for a shaders competition I
am participating in this March. This experience fits well with the hands-on work of this role,
particularly in display and optical systems used in flight simulation environments.
I have significant experience shipping production software in collaborative teams. I demon-
strated this during my co-op terms at Thales and through my robotics work at the McGill Engi-
neering Games, where I started as a team member and later led the team. During my most recent
internship at Thales, I improved system reliability by replacing deprecated dependencies across
multiple microservices. I did this by updating and verifying deployment configurations (Helm and
Kubernetes), validating GitLab CI/CD pipelines (defined in YAML files), and strengthening unit,
integration, and end-to-end tests. During my 2024 Thales internship, I worked on a support tool
made with Go. The software was new to me at the time, but I swiftly adapted to it and exceeded
expectations by completing 7 updates to the tool, compared to the 2 originally planned. I have also
built web applications with Vue.js, TypeScript, Go REST APIs, and MySQL. Thanks to these experi-
ences, I have built an excellent foundation in creating maintainable interfaces/APIs and debugging
end-to-end unexpected edge cases.
I would bring disciplined engineering execution to CAE through clean, well-organized code,
a strong testing mindset, and the ability to diagnose end-to-end behavior across software and
hardware constraints. I’m known as an approachable teammate who gives concise updates, asks
good questions, and enjoys collaborating across disciplines. Finally, I’m fluent in both French and
English, and am very comfortable working in a bilingual technical environment.
I’m applying with a direct referral from Samuel Perreault, who worked closely with me on the
McGill CS Games leadership team in 2025.
