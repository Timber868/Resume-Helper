# Resume and Cover Letter Rule Coordination

When generating or editing **custom resumes** or **cover letters** for specific jobs:

- **Always read and follow** the guidance in `.cursor/rules/resume-helper.mdc` for any resume tailoring work.
- **Always read and follow** the guidance in `.cursor/rules/cover-letter.mdc` for any cover letter tailoring work.
- Do **not** bypass or contradict these two rule files; treat them as the single source of truth for:
  - Which files to read/write under `data/master/` and `data/jobs/<job-id>/`
  - LaTeX structure, layout, naming conventions, and compilation steps
  - Selection, emphasis, and bolding strategy for skills and experience
- If both a tailored resume and cover letter are requested for the same job, apply the corresponding rule file for each artifact and keep filenames and short posting names consistent between them.
